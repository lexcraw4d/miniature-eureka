# About
The Note Taker Application was designed for users to create custom notes on-the-go. The Note Taker App allows users to create, save, and delete notes. The Note Taker App was created using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/),[Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/),[Heroku](http://heroku.com/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). 
Please visit [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBGQGzkXizTpFmDODRhGQycl0UWuVa2X/view?usp=sharing) for a live demo, since all of the generator is made via the command line.

#### GitHub/Git

In order to make effective changes to the website both [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) were used in synchronization to push commits of the latest updated version.

Git is version control system which allows multiple users to make changes to one single repository.

GitHub is a corporation which provides hosting for version control using Git and software development. [GitHub Docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings) provides all needs for setting up your GitHub and answering problem-solving issues you may come across while using GitHub.
